## 🔬 Summary

Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P₂] is a key signaling lipid that defines the inner leaflet of the eukaryotic plasma membrane. Although PI(4)P is its canonical precursor, previous studies showed that PI(4,5)P₂ levels remain unexpectedly robust under PI(4)P depletion.

Using live-cell TIRF microscopy in RBL mast cells, we discovered:
- First discovery of **periodic traveling waves of PI(4)P** at the plasma membrane, challenging the assumption that precursor lipids exist only in steady state.
- **Critical**rate of PI(4)P synthesis required for oscillations in both PI(4,5)P₂ and active **Cdc42**, a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton.
- **Quantitative insights** into lipid-driven cortical dynamics, pointing to a dynamical-systems view of membrane identity.
