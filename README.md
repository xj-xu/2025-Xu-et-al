The code focuses on processing and quantifying fluorescence intensity time series derived from TIRF microscopy experiments (e.g., oscillation period/amplitude estimation, baseline correction, and power-spectrum analysis). The accompanying processed datasets are deposited on Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18475604.

All analyses were performed using Python 3.10.12.
Users are recommended to run the code with Python 3.10 (or a compatible 3.10.x release) to ensure full compatibility with the listed dependencies.
